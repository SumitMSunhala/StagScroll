# StagScroll

StagScroll is a jQuery plugin that creates a container to support scrolling over large static data. It's designed to handle even massive datasets, and has been tested with up to 1 crore records.

## Features

- **Broad Compatibility**: StagScroll works with all modern browsers, ensuring your data can be accessed by a wide range of users.
- **Flexible Configuration**: The plugin offers many configuration options, allowing you to tailor its behavior to suit your needs.
- **Supports Various Elements**: StagScroll can be used with a variety of HTML elements, including tables (`<table>`), divisions (`<div>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), spans (`<span>`), and more.

## Configuration Options

- `data`: This should have the static array for which we have to create scrolling.
- `rowTemplate`: This could be a string or a function that will set each row template.
- `altRowTemplate`: This could be a string or a function that will set each alternate row template.
- `ssidField`: This field should specify the field of the data array above which has unique id number for each row.
- `height`: This specifies the height of the container element in pixels. (default 400px)
- `domElementsCount`: This specifies the max number of elements(records) inside the container. Default 200. Decide this cautiously based on your needs, as it could affect the performance, or result in misbehavior of the plugin or stop it completely.
- `lineNumber`: This is the line number where the plugin will focus by default. default is 1.
